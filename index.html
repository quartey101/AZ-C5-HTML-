    <h1>Rabies</h1>
    <h2>What is Rabies</h2>
    <p>
        Rabies is a viral disease: Rabies is caused by the rabies virus, which belongs to the <strong>genus</strong> <em>Lyssavirus</em>. It primarily affects the nervous system of mammals, including humans.
        It is transmitted through infected animal saliva: Rabies is usually transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal. The virus is present in the saliva of an infected animal and can enter the body through open wounds or mucous membranes.    <!--Explains what rabies is and some information about its transmission-->

    <h2>Transmission of Rabies</h2>
    <p>
        Common carriers of rabies include wild animals: <em>Wild animals</em>, such as bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and certain species of rodents, are common carriers of rabies. <em>Domestic animals</em> like dogs, cats, and livestock can also contract and transmit the virus if they are not vaccinated.
        Rabies is preventable through vaccination: Vaccination plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of rabies. Vaccinating domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, and practicing responsible pet ownership can significantly reduce the risk of rabies transmission to humans. <!--explains how rabies is transmitted-->

    <h2>What to do when bitten</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Prompt medical intervention is vital after exposure:</strong> If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal or suspect exposure to the rabies virus, seeking immediate medical attention is crucial. Timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes a series of vaccines and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin, can prevent the onset of rabies and save lives. <!--Gives an overview of what can be done if you have been exposed-->
